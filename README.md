## About Smith-Waterman algorithm
The Smithâ€“Waterman algorithm performs local sequence alignment to determine similar regions between two strings of nucleic acid sequences or protein sequences. When we consider the lengths of the two strings to be n and m, the naive approach has a runtime of O(n3m3), while the Smith-Waterman algorithm has a runtime O(nm).
